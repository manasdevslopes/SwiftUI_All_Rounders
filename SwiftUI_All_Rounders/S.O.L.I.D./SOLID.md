**Single Responsibility**
- If a single Class handling mulitiple responsibilities. But According to principle, it should handle single responsibility. By this it is easy to handle when things Grow and also to test properly (Unit Test) and it will be clean code.
- There should never be more than one reason for a class to change. A module or class should have only one responsibility, and that responsibility should be entirely encapsulated by that module / class.
