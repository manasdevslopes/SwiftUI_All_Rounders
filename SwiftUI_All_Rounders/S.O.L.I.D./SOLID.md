# Think Twice, Code Once.
# S.O.L.I.D. stands for
 
# S - Single Responsibility Principle
# O - Open-Closed Principle
# L - Liskov Substitution Principle
# I - Interface Segregation Principle
# D - Dependency Inversion Principle


# Why S.O.L.I.D. ?
# The SOLID principles helps you solve the main problems of a bad architecture.
# Maintaining & Extending as the project grows.

**Single Responsibility**
- If a single Class handling mulitiple responsibilities. But According to principle, it should handle single responsibility. By this it is easy to handle when things Grow and also to test properly (Unit Test) and it will be clean code.
- There should never be more than one reason for a class to change. A module or class should have only one responsibility, and that responsibility should be entirely encapsulated by that module / class.

**Open-Closed**
- Open for Extension and Closed for Modification

**Liskov Substitution**
- There is a Parent and child classes. And we are inheriting from Parent to CHild. So we don't have to change any functionality of base class (Parent Class) means override in Child Class. Use it as it is.
