# SwiftUI All Rounders
# Think Twice, Code Once.

# 1. S.O.L.I.D. Principles
    # S - Single Responsibility Principle
    # O - Open-Closed Principle
    # L - Liskov Substitution Principle
    # I - Interface Segregation Principle
    # D - Dependency Inversion Principle

# 2. Design Patterns
  # View Communication Patterns In SwiftUI
      1. From Parent To Direct Child - Use Initializer
      2. From Parent to Distant Child – Use Environment
      3. From Child to Direct Parent – Use Bindings (When we need to pass data in two ways) and Callbacks (When we need to pass data in one way)
      4. From Child to Distant Parent – Use PreferenceKey
      5. Between Children – Lift the State Up

  # Adapter Design Pattern
  # Factory Design Pattern

# 3. SwiftUI Components

# 4. UI/UX (Stewart Lynch/Sean Allen/Rebeloper/Kavsoft)
    # Custom Modifiers
    # GroupBoxes Customisations
    
# 5. AppleKits
      a. Image Pickers - Camera & Gallery
      b. WebView

# 6. Playgrounds
      # Date-Math using Calendar Component
      
# 7. Dependency Injection
    - Generic API calls (GET / POST) and Mock Service layer with Dependency Injection
