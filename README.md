# SwiftUI All Rounders
# Think Twice, Code Once.

# 1. S.O.L.I.D. Principles
    # S - Single Responsibility Principle
    # O - Open-Closed Principle
    # L - Liskov Substitution Principle
    # I - Interface Segregation Principle
    # D - Dependency Inversion Principle

# 2. Design Patterns
  # View Communication Patterns In SwiftUI
  1. From Parent To Direct Child - Use Initializer
  2. From Parent to Distant Child – Use Environment
  3. From Child to Direct Parent – Use Bindings (When we need to pass data in two ways) and Callbacks (When we need to pass data in one way)
  4. From Child to Distant Parent – Use PreferenceKey
  5. Between Children – Lift the State Up

# 3. SwiftUI Components

# 4. UI/UX (Kavsoft/Rebeloper/Sean Allen)
